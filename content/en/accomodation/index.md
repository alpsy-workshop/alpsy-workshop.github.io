<span style="color:red"><b>IMPORTANT</b></span>: Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, we are able to reduce the accommodation cost for PhD students to 90 euros per night.

The accommodation is arranged at the Obergurgl center of the University of Innsbruck from 25/01/2025 to 29/01/2025 (4 nights). You can pay for this 
accommodation upon arrival. 

If you plan to arrive earlier (e.g. on 24/01 or 23/01) then you can stay at the [Hotel Innsbruck](https://www.hotelinnsbruck.com) in the Innsburck city. A number of rooms are available at reduced 
rate. For more information on booking rooms at the hotel please contact Ms. Mitra-Yolanda Naderi (email: mitra [dot] naderi [at] uibk [dot] ac [dot] at).
